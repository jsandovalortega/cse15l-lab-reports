# Lab 5 Report ðŸ™‚
## Design a debugging scenario, and write your report as a conversation on EdStem :bowtie:

1. The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is. (Don't actually make the post! Just write the content that would go in such a post)
2. A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)
3. Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.
4. At the end, all the information needed about the setup including:
- The file & directory structure needed
- The contents of each file before fixing the bug
- The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
- A description of what to edit to fix the bug
